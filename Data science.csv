The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Who We Are
Teamflow is the all-in-one collaboration hub helping remote and hybrid teams collaborate with the least possible amount of friction.
Unlike traditional videoconferencing tools that require scheduled meetings and produce a lot of ‘Zoom fatigue’, Teamflow is all about enabling spontaneous, focused collaboration and teamwork.
It shows your video in a bubble on a virtual office floor plan. You can move that bubble around, like in a video game, and only hear the people around you.

So your team can collaborate in this space, and when you want to chat with someone, you can just walk over to them and say hi, just like you would in real life — no more Zoom-scheduling nightmare.
The end result is better meetings, less Zoom fatigue, higher employee engagement and ultimately, a more productive and collaborative workplace.
To date, we’ve raised $50m from top-tier venture capitalists including Menlo Ventures, Battery Ventures, Elad Gil, Coatue, and others. You can read about our most recent fundraise in this article by Forbes magazine.
Teamflow is growing fast. Thousands of companies use our platform to power their collaboration, and we’re making some noise out there — TIME Magazine listed Teamflow as one of the “Best Inventions of 2021”.
This makes Teamflow an exciting place to work! There are tons of opportunities to grow, gain valuable experience, and pursue interesting ideas — we’re still small and nimble, but well-funded enough to dream big and swing for the fences.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

About the Role
Data is central to Twitch's decision-making process, and data scientists are a critical component to evangelize data-driven decision making in all of our operations.

Create analytical frameworks to measure team success: partner with cross-functional teams to define success metrics, create approaches to track the data and troubleshoot errors, quantify and evaluate the data, then develop a common language for all colleagues to understand these KPIs.
Operationalize data processes - provide the team with ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools so that everyone gets a good sense of the state of the business.
